# Door-Lock-System

Discription
 
This code is an example of a simple password-protected system written in assembly language using MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler). The program prompts the user to enter a password, and if the entered password matches the pre-defined correct password, the user is allowed to enter a new key value. If the entered password is incorrect, the program displays an error message and allows the user to try again up to three times before asking for an administrator password. If the user enters an incorrect password more than three times, the program asks for an administrator password, and if the entered password matches the pre-defined administrator password, the user is allowed to proceed.
